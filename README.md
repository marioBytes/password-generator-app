## My process

### Built with

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - JS framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

From this point forward I want to utilize the Angular framework. Coming from a React background, I am a big fan of how opinionated Angular has been.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51540480/10462660) - This helped me in generating a more secure password, by suggesting the use of Crypto.getRandomValues() rather than using the Math.random() functionality.
- [Crypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues) - The MDN docs on Crypto helped give me a deeper understanding on how the API works.
- [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/docs) - I have never built anything with Angular up until this point. In utilizing the docs I was able to understand the lifecycle of components, and how props are passed from parents to children and vice versa.
